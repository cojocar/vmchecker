# assignment configuration
#
# syntax:
# [assignment NAME]
# Deadline      = date
# Machine       = an id of the machine used in testing
# timeout       = a timeout for test execution (override the default)
# AssignmentTitle = a human readable name
# statementlink = a link to the statement
# OrderNumber   = the number of the assignment (used for sorting)
# WaitForVmwareToolsTimeout =
#
#       Optional paramter.
#
#       If WaitForVmwareToolsTimeout is not set, vmchecker waits
#       indefinetly (well not really, the queue manager kills the
#       executor after the global timeout expires).
#
#       This setting is useful when the machines are uploaded by the
#       students and the tools are not preconfigured and we don't want
#       to wait until the global timeout expires.
#
# RevertToSnapshot = [yes|true|y|no]
#
#       Optional paramter.
#
#       If not specified, defaults to 'yes' and reverts the virtual
#       machine to it's last snapshot. If the snapshots are not
#       organized in a straight line (some vmware solutions permit
#       creating trees of snapshots) behaviour is not specified
#       (hasn't been tested yet).
#
#       Normally machines should have a 'last' snapshot in a state
#       that is useful for testing. Having a snapshot cuts the bootup
#       time. Set to 'no' when you really want the machine to boot up
#       by itself.
#
# DelayBetweenToolsAndTests = delay in seconds.
#
#       Optional paramter.
#
#       If not set defaults to '0'. After Vmware tools are loaded,
#       there may be some time before the machine is actually usable
#       (services like apache, mysql, et al. must be started). This
#       defines an amount of time (in seconds) to wait after tools are
#       up, but before starting to run the tests.
#
# SubmitOnly = [yes|true|y|no]
#
#      Optional parameter.
#
#      Default is 'no'. If true, then this assignment is used only as a
#      versioning system -- i.e. there is no testing involved, what is submited
#      is saved in the storer.
#
# SendUsername = [yes|true|y|no]
#
#      Optional parameter.
#
#      Default is 'no'. If true, then a file named '_username' is created in the
#      test environment (on the vm). This file contains the username under
#      which the submission was done. The username is useful for testing assignemnts
#      that are customized per user.
#
# ShowGradesBeforeDeadline = [yes|true|y|no]
#
#      Optional parameter.
#
#      Default is 'no'. If true, then the grades are showed (in the general
#      view) before the deadline is reached. Meaning that all the students
#      (even the ones that are not registered), can view other's grades.
#
# IgnoredVmrs = grade.vmr, late-submission.vmr etc.
#
#     Optional parameter.
#
#     Default is a an empty list. Viewing all the details can be
#     confusing for a student. The most simple way is to display
#     compiling (stdout and stderr) and testing (stdout and stderr).
#     A good default is:
#       vmchecker-stderr.vmr grade.vmr late-submission.vmr run-km.vmr
#
# DeadlineIsHard
#
#    Optional parameter
#
#    Set to true if you want to disable upload after the deadline of the
#    assignment. Default is 'no'
#
# MaxSubmissionSize
#
#    Optional parameter
#
#    Specify the maximum number of bytes that the unpacked archive can
#    have. Example: 10MB, 23k
#
#    Default: 10MB
#
# # These are only for Large assignments
# AssignmentStorage = Large               # this is a MD5Submission.
# AssignmentStoragePort = 22              # the ssh port to use
# AssignmentStorageHost = orion.cs.pub.ro # where to look for uploaded vms
# AssignmentStorageBasepath = /home       # where on that machine to look
# AssignmentStorageQueryUser = root       # which user to logon with.
# UnpackArchive = [yes|y|true]            # whether the archive's contents
                                          # should be expanded. Default: no
